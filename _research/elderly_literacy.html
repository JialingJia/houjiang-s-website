		<p>As the elderly population increases, their technology and health illiteracy are becoming social problems
			because those problems hinder them from accessing service networks that are increasingly mediated by
			information technology and mobile devices. Technology literacy is a pre-requisite for autonomy because it is
			the infrastructure for people to make better sense of the world to plan out their actions. Additionally,
			health literacy is also the priority for autonomy because it is the first issue to maintain the wellbeing of
			older adults.</p>
		<p> This project contains a series of sub-projects targeting on understanding the barriers of older adults
			accessing to technology and health literacy from ethnographic and statistical studies and exploring
			different design interventions ranging from gamifications, workshops, and user experience prototypes. The
			project is implemented in different places and collaborated with professors and researchers from
			Northeastern University in Boston, America and Hohai University in Jiangsu province, China. Prof. Miso Kim
			is the primary investigator who leads studies in Boston city, America. Prof. Canqun He is the
			co-investigator who leads studies in Jiangsu province, China. As the research assistant of the project, I
			mainly led the statistical analysis and design research studies in the Research phase and the gamification
			in the Design phase.</p>

		<h3>Technology Literacy</h3>
	</div>

	<div class="flow-half">
		<p>In this study, we conducted ethnographic research to understand the factors and patterns of <b>older adults’
				autonomy</b> in relation to technology, including a survey of 94 participants and 20 interviews in
			Boston (FIG 1) and a survey of 151 participants and 20 interviews in Jiangsu. Using key insights from our
			research, <b>we designed a preliminary service system to support seniors' adoption of rapidly changing
				technologies, while maintaining their sense of autonomy</b>. The service system includes workshops with
			board games, self-learning toolkits, and technology learning courses ranging from beginner to intermediate
			levels. Those tools and community-based courses connected seniors with student volunteers, community
			centers, and local libraries.</p>
		<p>In the research phase, I used exploratory factor analysis and cluster analysis to find patterns that
			participants share in the survey and understand <b>how older adults' autonomy and participations influence
				their technology adoption</b>. First, we found main factors from the question which demonstrate
			representative features of seniors, including seniors who have strong leadership qualities, who are
			tech-savvy and who feel positive in learning technology. In total, we concluded ten main features from their
			responses. Second, three groups of respondents are clustered with similar responses to those
			characteristics. From the statistical survey analysis, we understood there are three main groups from our
			participants with different autonomy and participation levels. Then, in our design research, we built three
			personas based on the similar characteristics of the groups.</p>
		<p>Inspired by the interviews with seniors, we found that <b>game</b> might be a good leverage point to enhance
			seniors’ technology learning. In the design phase, I gamified the learning process based on their learning
			curves. We created three games which targeted on beginner level, intermediate level, and advanced level of
			learning. These games have been tested with nine community volunteers (FIG 2).</p>
		<p>Apart from games, we also designed other service touch points to build our service blueprint, including
			workshops and digital applications for older adults. To explore different app ideas, I assigned group
			project in my teaching class: ARTG 2401 interaction design tools, for undergrads to brainstorm and prototype
			different apps based on the levels of technology learning. In the class, we came up with three app ideas:
			first is to gamify the process of learning technical terminology, second is to create references to track
			progress and materials for offline learning workshops, third is to create a communication portal for older
			users to easily connect with community volunteers. Instructed by the wireframe and app workflow (FIG 3),
			students prototyped their app ideas and tested with professional UX designers who have worked for Microsoft,
			Baidu, and Thomson Reuters (FIG 4).</p>

		<h3>Health Autonomy</h3>
	</div>

	<div class="flow-full">
		<p>In relation to the study of health autonomy for older adults, we examined current difficulties in their
			health management by a healthcare experience walkthrough and designed community healthcare toolkits to
			support their health decision-making process. We interviewed 20 participants, including seniors and
			caregivers, and conceptualized seniors’ behavior patterns in terms of their barriers and motivations in
			using technology and healthcare.</p>
		<p>In this project, I mainly conducted the interviews and designed the participatory workshop. In the first
			workshop, I designed several toolkits, including probes cards and templates for community assistants to
			brainstorm solutions to the most pressing issues affecting the daily health of seniors. In the second
			workshops, I designed codesign toolkits for seniors to develop self-learning courses. Some results have been
			presented as a poster in the RISE conference.</p>

		<p>Nowadays, the group is working with the Peabody Property, a real estate company who provides affordable
			housing and seniors community services to implement the service ideas, tools, games, and workshops from the
			technology literacy projects and the health autonomy project to help seniors get through the difficult time
			when they are isolated during covid-19.</p>
