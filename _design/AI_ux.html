		<p>When I worked as a freelance designer, I cooperated with <a target="_blank"
				href="https://seetatech.com/">Seetatech</a>, an AI start-up in China, to build a deep
			learning platform for business use ranging from industrial face recognition, self-service retail, and
			intelligent animal farming. The application now has being used by Ping’ An Insurance company and <a target="_blank"

		<h3>Design AI for business use vs. end-users</h3>
	</div>

	<div class="flow-half">
		<p>It is interesting to find that there are different usage scenarios of AI when it comes to business users
			versus personal users. For business users, the most important thing of AI development is to “get job done” - deploy AI applications in scale.
			For example, when it comes to predict the health condition of cows’ growth based on their morphological
			features, practitioners focus on completing the predictions from their mass data base in an effective way.
			Based on our research, the user flow of business practitioner simply as the following steps: <b>upload the
				data, label the data, select the model, and used the model to train the dataset</b>. Therefore, to ease
			the training process, <b>we create functions and web interactions that are simple enough for batch
				operations</b>. Additionally, we also create seamless service that connect the operation from data labeling
			to training. As most of business practitioners are not technically AI developers, we integrate the
			development process into a graphic interface to make the process easy to understand.</p>
		<p>Different from business users, most of personal users are AI developers. And their major efforts are spent on fine-tuning
			models or testing models in different use context. Although most python IDE and notebook
			applications have provided rich coding environment for developers, it is still difficult for them to
			reproduce models from scratch. Thus, <b>we design functions and
				templates that standardize the training process and parameters tuning for developers to quickly adopt
				new models from open-sourced platforms, like HuggingFace.</b> Additionally, we also integrated different evaluation
			metrics within the graphic interface dashboard to test the model performance.</p>
		<p>Finally, we designed two platforms for the business and end-users: SeeTaaS and AutoDL. SeeTaaS is an industrial-level platform which integrated data management, built-in algorithms with hyper-parameter fine-tuning, and
			computation power as an enterprise AI platform. AutoDL is a personalized model training platform that provides popular
			deep learning dataset and algorithms for AI developers to customize AI applications. Accompanied with these two deep learning platforms, we also designed a data labeling website
			and a data Kanban.</p>

	<div class="flow-full">
		<p>Design patterns help streamline AI development process and make it friendly to use when it comes to
			people who are not familiar with AI. In consumer markets, AI is more like
			a tool rather than research subject. Therefore, when AI development is translated into graphic components that allow users to drag and move, 
			it lowers the barrier for non-AI expert to quickly adopt and deploy model into practice.</p>
