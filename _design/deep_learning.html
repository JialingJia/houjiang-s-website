		<p>When I worked as a freelance designer, I cooperated with <a
				href="https://www.seetatech.com/index_e.html">Seetatech</a>, an AI start-up in China, to build a deep
			learning platform for business use ranging from industrial face recognition, self-service retail, and
			intelligent animal farming. The application now has being used by Ping’ An Insurance company and <a
				href="https://www.ksyun.com/nv/product/KDL.html">Kingsoft Deep Learning</a>. Here, I would like to
			summarize some design insights and ideas when I built those deep learning products from a user-centered
			perspective. Design details are not expanded here due to confidential agreements and related regulations.

		<h3>Design AI for business use versus personal use</h3>
	</div>

	<div class="flow-half">
		<p>It is interesting to find that there are different usage scenarios of AI when it comes to business users
			versus personal users. For business users, the most important things of applying AI is to “get job done”.
			For example, when it comes to predict the health condition of cows’ growth based on their morphological
			features, practitioners focus on completing the predictions from their mass data base in an effective way.
			Based on our research, the user flow of business practitioner simply as the following steps: <b>upload the
				data, label the data, select the model, and used the model to train the dataset</b>. Therefore, to ease
			the training process, <b>we create functions and web interactions that are simple enough for batch
				operations</b>. Additionally, we also create seamless service that connect the operation of labeling
			data to training data. As most business practitioners are not identically AI developers, we transform the
			coding process into graphic interface to make the processes of AI training easy to understand.</p>
		<p>Different from business users, most personal users are AI developers. And most of their work are fine-tuning
			models and exploring the usages of models in different occasions. Although most python IDE and notebook
			applications have provided rich coding environment for developers, it is still difficult for developers to
			reproduce models from others during their learning processes. Therefore, <b>we designed functions and
				templates that standardize the training processes and parameters tuning for developers to quickly adopt
				new models from conferences and papers.</b> Additionally, we also integrated different evaluation
			metrics within the graphic interface dashboard to show the modeling results.</p>
		<p>Finally, we designed two deep learning platforms for both users: SeeTaaS and AutoDL. SeeTaaS is an industrial
			level platform which integrated data management, built-in algorithms with hyper-parameter tuning, and
			computation power for enterprise AI application. AutoDL is a model training platform that provides popular
			deep learning dataset and algorithms for AI developers to customize model training for customized
			applications. Accompanied with these two deep learning platforms, I also designed a data labeling website
			and a data Kanban.</p>

		<h3>Integrate AI components with design patterns</h3>
		<p>Although Deep learning is full of knowledge in the areas of computer science and data processing, design
			patterns help to physicalize the process of deep learning and make it friendly to use when it comes to
			people who are not familiar with the algorithms and model evaluations. In consumer markets, AI is more like
			a tool rather than research subject. Therefore, when deep learning is designed in graphic interface for use,
			there are opportunities to modularize data managements, modal training, testing, and parameters fine-tuning
			with design components, widgets, modals, and flows.</p>

			specific datasets. By combinging the autodl local system with its online distributed platform, practitioners
			can update their experiments with the best results and share with others.</figcaption>
