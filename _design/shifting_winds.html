	<p>Every researcher alive today had their
        mentors, those who helped assimilate them
        into a life of scholarly work. And in turn
        they each had their mentors, and so on to the
        dawn of knowledge. In the same way, each
        researcher’s mentees take their perspectives
        and methods to future mentees, and to their
        mentees, etc.</p>
  <p>These comprise the roots and
    branches, respectively, of the academic tree of
    a single researcher. If we let these ancestors’
    and descendants’ genders affect these trees
    like a “wind,” most curl nearly to the earth.
    We depict and describe the structure of
    these trees, and how this wind has changed
    over the decades. To set these trees growing
    upright again we visualize giving differential
    weight to male and female researchers.</p>

	<h3>Data Processing and Visualization</h3>
</div>

<div class="flow-half">
	<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01578-x">MENTORSHIP dataset</a> which we use is based
        on the <a href="https://academictree.org/">Academic Family Tree</a>, a crowdsourced effort to collect aca-
        demic genealogy. Registered users can input, update, or confirm the
        information posted there. This includes relational data, keeping track
        of advisors and their advisees, collaborators, research assistants, and
        postdoctoral students. The dataset now holds 774,733 researchers
        in total across 112 fields. </p>
	<p>To narrow down the scope of visualizations and make sure that
        the mentorship data contains relatively complete and correct
        information for visualization, we investigate only the most
        represented research areas. These research areas are anthropology,
        cell biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, history,
        linguistics, literature, math, microbiology, neuroscience,
        nursing, philosophy, physics, political science, and sociology.</p>
	<p>We draw these trees with equal female
        and male curls, and record their width and height. We also record
        the radius and curvature of each mentee in the tree (see Figure 1).
        The tallest and widest trees, then, correspond to the maximum
        height and width of these drawn trees across 16 research fields.
        By averaging the radius of curvature over all mentees in each tree,
        we find the most tilted trees, to the right and to the left. And by
        computing the standard deviation of all curvature for each datapoint,
        we find the most diverse tree, the tree with the most variation in
        curl amongst its mentees. We depict the widest and tallest tree,
        the most tilted trees, and the most diverse tree on the website. All
        code for generating these visualizations is 
        <a href="https://github.com/JialingJia/scimap-FA-2021">available online</a>.</p>
