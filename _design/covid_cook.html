	<p> Home-cooking has become as a way to pass hours and feel productive, a form to entertain ourselves, and even an outlet to channel all the anxieties. Sharing food, as well as sharing food experiences can help create a new sense of community while people are isolated.</p>
  <p>By displaying hundreds of posts/images of home-cooking food that people share on a Reddit community <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/covidcookery/">Covidcookery</a>, we hope users can discover some fun from seeing what people are eating and how people treat food/cooking in their life during the pandemic. Moreover, to think about how the reality changes peopleâ€™s diets and how sharing food has changed/enriched our life.</p>

	<h3>Data Processing and Visualization</h3>
</div>

<div class="flow-half">
	<p>To process our data, we firstly used Google Script to extract all post titles, images, and other metadata from the subreddit ranging from the subreddit's opening date to November 24 (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tT2lcPHudHsnlxRM84M2LZan4QMOJdxYFI_KhOy59W0/edit?usp=sharing">data</a>). Second, we used features of Spacy, including lemmatization and name recognition to identify all food names based on similarity of a number of food corpus that we collected from the web. After filtering keywords' similarity over 0.9, we also did several rounds of manual cleaning to ensure its accuracy.</p>
	<p>To visualize our data, we firstly converted our dataset into a network file by connnecting different dishes with the same food ingredients. Second, we aggregated times of food ingredients that have been used daily to perform the racing bar chart.</p>
	<p>Finally, our visualization contains two sections, one force-directed graph of cooking dishes and ingredients and a racing bar chart showing the summary of top 20 food ingredients.</p>
