		<p>Hello! This is Houjiang~ Recently, I am looking for future studies in the field of Design and HCI! Welcome to view and give feedback on my recent master thesis:</p>
		<p><a target="_blank" title="thesis" href="https://1drv.ms/b/s!Ak55tr-1XMS7grVP8Tv3pjahOzTYDA"> <i>Enriching Gifts, Experience Design to Understand Human Relationships</i></a></p>
		<p>
		I have graduated with a degree in <b>MFA</b> of <b>Experience Design</b> at Northeastern University. I am also a design research assistant working at the Center <i>for</i> Design and a graduate teaching fellow at CAMD. In my graduate study, I focus research in <b>Public Health and Services specifically for seniors' technology and healthcare services</b>, <b>Human Relationships through Gifts Interventions</b>, and <b>Human Experience in Urban Envrionment</b>. As a researcher, I am good at ethnographic studies, statistical analysis, and design research. As an Experience Designer, I am now designing services and apps for older users to learn technology. Additionally, I also have extensive experience of designing for Deep Learning platforms and Online Ecommerce. If you want to have a chat about projects or new opportunities, please feel free to contact me: <i>liuhoujiang@hotmail.com</i>.
