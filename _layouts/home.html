			<p>你好, my name is <b>Houjiang Liu</b> ("Whole ji oy LOU") ~ I am a doctoral student (2021 to present), studying HCI and Human-centered AI at the School of Information, UT Austin. 
				Currently, I am advised by professor <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~ml/">Matthew Lease</a>, applying NLP in tooling professional 
				fact-checking to combat mis/disinformation. While most of my current research has to do with AI, I prefer seeing myself as a designer, framing AI applications 
				from a humanistic perspective.
						
			<p>Previously, I was a design researcher at the <a target="_blank"
					href="https://camd.northeastern.edu/center-for-design/">Center for Design</a> at the Northeastern University, working
				with professor <a href="https://camd.northeastern.edu/faculty/miso-kim/">Miso Kim</a> on
				designing services grounded in autonomy and <a href="https://camd.northeastern.edu/faculty/paolo-ciuccarelli/">Paolo
						Ciuccarelli</a> on visualizing interactive network graphs. I was also a part-time lecturer
				teaching Interaction Design in CAMD at Northeastern. Before starting my PhD at UT, I was a User Experience Designer, working at <a target="_blank" href="https://jelly.jd.com/">JD.com (Beijing)</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://seetatech.com/">SeetaTech AI (Beijing)</a>. </p>
