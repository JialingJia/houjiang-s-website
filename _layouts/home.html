			<p>你好, my name is Houjiang Liu ("Whole ji oy LOU") ~ I am a doctoral student (starting from 2021), studying <b>HCI</b> and <b>Human-centered AI</b> at the School of Information, UT Austin.
			
			<p>Currently, I am advised by professor <b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~ml/">Matthew
						Lease</a></b>, applying explainable NLP in tooling professional fact-checking to combat mis/disinformation. 
						While most of my current research has to do with AI, I prefer seeing myself as a designer, framing AI applications with a humanistic perspective, such as fairness, autonomy, and dignity.
						
			<p>Previously, I was a design researcher at the <i><a target="_blank"
					href="https://camd.northeastern.edu/center-for-design/">Center for Design</a></i> at the Northeastern University, working

				designing services grounded in human autonomy and <b><a href="https://camd.northeastern.edu/faculty/paolo-ciuccarelli/">Paolo
						Ciuccarelli</a></b> on visualizing interactive network graphs. I was also a part-time lecturer
				teaching Interaction Design in CAMD at Northeastern.</p>

			<p>Before starting my PhD at UT, I was a User Experience Designer, working at <i><a target="_blank" href="https://jelly.jd.com/">JD.com (Beijing)</a></i> and <i><a target="_blank" href="https://seetatech.com/">SeetaTech AI (Beijing)</a></i>.
