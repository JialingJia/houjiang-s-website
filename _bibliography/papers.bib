               residents and facilitate coproduction. The outcome included

  abstract = "Gifts are experiential objects that are imbued with human
              feelings and also reciprocal objects that invoke social
              interactions. Gifts help to build, enhance, and maintain human
              relationships by forming physical and emotional connections.
              Gifts not only embody aesthetic value via their appearance as
              physical things but also reflect the feelings and routine
              practices of the culture within which they are exchanged.
              However, in the field of design, most scholarship is still
              focused on the gift as a thing rather than the experience
              surrounding it. Designers need to not only explore the physical
              properties of materials when they are designing a product that
              can be given as a gift, but also the related socially ritualized
              behaviors and subjective sensory experiences that those
              properties have embodied. In this thesis, I propose that when
              designing a gift, designers design not only things but also
              experiences. Thus, this thesis explores the emotional and
              subjective meanings surrounding gifts rather than the meanings
              associated with their physical properties.",

                technology adoption could enhance older adults' quality of
                life, little is known about seniors' sense of autonomy while
                using technology. In this study, we conducted ethnographic
                research including surveys and interviews to learn about
                seniors' technology usage in relation to their sense of

                synthesize patterns and used our design research findings to

                four major service design guidelines to help enhance the
                technology literacy of seniors: a changed mindset from singular
                problem-solving to pluralistic motivations, a meaningful

                to receive remote geriatric education due to social distancing
                mandates. However, for older adults who lack technology
                literacy, there has been limited access to remote nursing
                assistance. Although the mandate has been effective in reducing

                seek digital services, such as online banking and ridesharing
                services, as readily as younger people and are therefore
                isolated from these services benefits. In this project, we
                adopted personal autonomy and communal participation as
                principles for designing services to improve older adults'
                technology learning experiences. We began the research by
                conducting surveys and interviews to better understand how
                older adults use digital technologies and how their
                interactions with these technologies are interrelated with
                their sense of autonomy and participation. Factor and cluster
                analyses were used to determine the correlation between older
                adults' self-autonomous behaviours and the digital technologies
                they use daily. Employing quantitative and qualitative
                analyses, we developed three types of personas based on older
                adults' technology-literacy levels, motivations, and barriers.
                In partnership with a local senior living community, we
                proposed an educational service to improve older adults'
                technology literacy and prototyped three community games to
                address the specific problems that older adults experience
                while learning digital technologies. Due to the outbreak of the
                COVID-19 pandemic, we remotely tested these games with
                coordinators and educators from local senior centres. This
                research's findings also influenced the design of a service to
                support isolated older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
