  abstract = "Gifts are experiential objects that are imbued with human
              feelings and also reciprocal objects that invoke social
              interactions. Gifts help to build, enhance, and maintain human
              relationships by forming physical and emotional connections.
              Gifts not only embody aesthetic value via their appearance as
              physical things but also reflect the feelings and routine
              practices of the culture within which they are exchanged.
              However, in the field of design, most scholarship is still
              focused on the gift as a thing rather than the experience
              surrounding it. Designers need to not only explore the physical
              properties of materials when they are designing a product that
              can be given as a gift, but also the related socially ritualized
              behaviors and subjective sensory experiences that those
              properties have embodied. In this thesis, I propose that when
              designing a gift, designers design not only things but also
              experiences. Thus, this thesis explores the emotional and
              subjective meanings surrounding gifts rather than the meanings
              associated with their physical properties.",

                mandates. However, for older adults who lack technology
                literacy, there has been limited access to remote nursing
                assistance. Although the mandate has been effective in reducing

                isolated from these services benefits. In this project, we
                adopted personal autonomy and communal participation as
                principles for designing services to improve older adults'
                technology learning experiences. We began the research by
                conducting surveys and interviews to better understand how
                older adults use digital technologies and how their
                interactions with these technologies are interrelated with
                their sense of autonomy and participation. Factor and cluster
                analyses were used to determine the correlation between older
                adults' self-autonomous behaviours and the digital technologies
                they use daily. Employing quantitative and qualitative
                analyses, we developed three types of personas based on older
                adults' technology-literacy levels, motivations, and barriers.
                In partnership with a local senior living community, we
                proposed an educational service to improve older adults'
                technology literacy and prototyped three community games to
                address the specific problems that older adults experience
                while learning digital technologies. Due to the outbreak of the
                COVID-19 pandemic, we remotely tested these games with
                coordinators and educators from local senior centres. This

                     together human relationships. While people often treat it
                     as a token of social interactions, the presentation of a
                     gift could impose an identity that reflects gift-givers'
                     images of gift-receivers. Because gift-giving is a social
                     behaviour situated in the cultural and economic context,
                     the perceived value of gifts is greatly affected by the
                     social norms and the consumer market, in which design
                     plays an important role. In this paper, we first discuss
                     how commodities can be transformed into gifts and what
                     kinds of design activities influence such transformations.
                     We found that most relevant designs for commercial gifts
                     are giver-centred with less regard to the concern of
                     gift-receivers. Second, we consider people to be designers
                     themselves, so that each step of the gift-giving could be
                     intentionally framed, influencing the consequences of
                     giving a gift. To this regard, we want to help people
                     identify what affects their perceived differences between
                     thinking of a gift as a token of gratitude or an
                     imposition of identity. We conducted a small design
                     research by designing a gift-giving social game, which
                     situated participants in an imaginary gift-giving
                     environment to understand others' gift preferences.
                     Additionally, the game also helps designers to observe
                     participants' natural reflections on the past experiences
                     and capture their interpretations of gifts and gift-giving
                     based on different human relationships. By presenting
                     preliminary findings from the game playtests, we hope to
                     inform future design activities, either at an
                     individual-level or collective-level, to facilitate
                     positive consequences of gift-giving.",
