		<p> This project aimed to create a collection of data visualization for Intesa SanPaolo, the leading Italian
			banking group, to explore the impacts of its training program on the growth of knowledge depth in the
			corporate. Our team provided an interactive web application for our client as the final deliverable. We
			first used Gephi to generate static network image, then put together all graphs in a user interface and
			developed it using D3. The interactive prototype will be used for exploring the value of the current
			training program and supporting the future development and
			business plan.</p>
		<p>In this application, users can explore the knowledge data within the company and customize the data displayed
			through visualization. They can get an overview of data and dive into the data through interactions,
			including scaling, filtering, linking, etc. We integrated the knowledge distribution and the position
			hierarchy of the bank into the web application by combining two main views — the network view and the
			hierarchy view — to display the data. The users can switch between two views easily and drill into segments
			of interest through interactions.</p>

	<div class="flow-full">
		<p>In the beginning, we experimented with various visual forms to map the first set of data we received, such as
			network, circle packing, flow chart, stacked bar chart, etc. The tools we used include Gephi, Raw Graph, and
			Adobe Illustrator. After exchanging ideas in internal meetings and discussing our ideas with the client
			along the process, we then narrowed down our focus to network mapping and contour maps to represent the
			knowledge data and its corresponding attributes. Please view more visuals in the presentation file attached
			in the Deliverables section.</p>

		<h3>Web Application</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="flow-half">
		<p>To better help our client explore the knowledge data within the company and customize the data displayed
			through visualization, we proposed designing an interactive web application as the final deliverable. In
			this application, users can get an overview of data and dive into the data through interactions, including
			scaling, filtering, linking, etc.We used Adobe Xd to present our interface design and create a clickable
			prototype for simulation navigation
			of the application.

		<h5>Knowledge Network</h5>
	</div>
	<div class="flow-half">
		<p>The network graph shows different relations between knowledge areas and employees. It visualizes:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The bigger the nodes the more employees that share this knowledge area;</li>
			<li>The closer the distance between one knowledge node and one employee node, the higher the evaluation
				score of the corresponding knowledge that the employee gets; </li>
			<li>The cluster of knowledge nodes means some employees possess those knowledge areas in common with
				others;</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			To explore the data from different dimensions, including the employees’ demographic attributes and knowledge
			structures, we add several features so that users can sort or filter the data:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>filter the knowledge network by location;</li>
			<li>filter the knowledge network by position;</li>
			<li>display employees’ attributes in terms of gender, age group, and persona;</li>
			<li>display evaluation scores of each knowledge area;</li>
			<li>simulate changes in knowledge distribution by adding/removing a group of employees.</li>
		</ol>

		<h5>Position Hierarchy</h5>
	</div>
	<div class="flow-half">
		<p>In this view, we chose a radial tree to show the hierarchical divisions in the bank. Users can explore the
			knowledge depth within each division of the company. Each node represents a position ID. The highest
			position is the root, and the sub-divisions spread out from the center. We also designed features to let
			users navigate the hierarchical divisions:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>filter the position hierarchy by location;</li>
			<li>filter the position hierarchy by knowledge area/domain;</li>
			<li>display the number of employees under each position;</li>
			<li>display the evaluation score of the chosen knowledge area/domain under each position</li>
			<li>simulate changes in the hierarchy view by adding/removing a group of employees</li>
		</ol>
